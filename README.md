# Overview

I want to write a program that demonstrates a basic understanding of C++. I want to learn how to work with topics such as variables, functions, text files, and user input. C++ is a high performance language used by many companies today. This program will help me to learn the basics and some advanced techniques as well.

The software is a basic arithmetic calculator that takes in 2 number inputs. The user can then enter which operation they wish to perform on those 2 numbers. It then performs that operation and displays the result to the screen, it saves that equation to a text file called history.txt. The program continues until the user tells the program no to continue.

# Development Environment

I mainly used W3 school to learn the syntax for i/o and also learned how to write basic functions, and printing. I also used chatGPT to help me figure out why my program wasn't working to write to the text file, it didn't help much. I didn't really use chatGPT for anything else.

I only used C++, inside of C++ I used a library to read and write to text files called fstream.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Make the program able to take in a string and compute a more complex problem like 2+4*7.
- Make the text file save between each run instead of erasing.
- Better or more advanced UI, perhaps an html.
